One of the most frequent types of day-to-day conversion is text communication. In our everyday routine, we chat, message, tweet, share status, email, create blogs, and offer opinions and criticism. All of these actions lead to a substantial amount of unstructured text being produced. It is critical to examine huge amounts of data in this sector of the online world and social media to determine people's opinions. Text mining is also referred to as text analytics. Text mining is a process of exploring sizable textual data and finding patterns. Text Mining processes the text itself, while NLP processes with the underlying metadata. Finding frequency counts of words, length of the sentence, presence/absence of specific words is known as text mining. Natural language processing is one of the components of text mining. NLP helps identify sentiment, finding entities in the sentence, and category of blog/article. Text mining is preprocessed data for text analytics. In Text Analytics, statistical and machine learning algorithms are used to classify information.
